Speed adjustement
-----------------

	Speed of the game can be adjusted by configuring 2 values in pacman.ini file. 
	Value on first line is sound effects delay, in milliseconds, and second line set game delay, also in milliseconds
	Here are some test that I made with differents configurations

REAL HARDWARE
-------------
	Values tested with a notebook Toshiba Satellite 2995XDVD, running w98 (in pure dos mode) are:
	1
	20
	Note: boot without any EMS memory manager like EMM386, otherwise performance will be severe degraded and monster will move in a strange manner

	and running from windows: 
	1
	20


Emulation
---------
	Runnin on DosBOX
	0
	10


	Runnin on MS DOS 6.22 (on VirtualBox)
	2
	20
	Note: boot without any EMS memory manager like EMM386, otherwise performance will be degraded and monsters will move in a strange manner


	Runnin on Freedos (on VirtualBox)
	2
	20
	Note: boot without any EMS memory manager like EMM386, otherwise performance will be degraded and monsters will move in a strange manner
	In Freedos option number 3 (Load Freedos without drivers)
